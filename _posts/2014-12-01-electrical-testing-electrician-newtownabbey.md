<h1>Electrical Testing in the Greater Belfast areas</h1><p>  
</p><h2>EICR Testing</h2><p>  
</p><p>An EICR or Electrical Condition Report will show the condition of the electrical wiring in a property and checks the safety of the electrical installation. This type of electrical testing is carried out every five years in a commercial building and ten years in a domestic property, however this does depend on the age and condition of the installation that is being tested.</p><p>  
</p><p>One of our fully qualified electricians will attend your property when convenient for you and carry out 100% testing where possible. Upon completion of testing an NICEIC certificate will be issued and sent to you for your records.</p><p>  
</p><p>Should anything fail then we will let you know on your certificate why it has failed and issue a recommendation sheet and include a free no obligation quote for your consideration.</p><p>  
</p><h3>P.A.T. Testing</h3><p>  
</p><p>You may have heard this type of testing referred to as PAT testing. This type of testing is a vital part of your Health and Safety requirements in the workplace and is a form of electrical safety testing to establish how safe the electrical items you use on a day to day basis. This can be anything from a computer, kettle or fan in your workplace and we can even carry out a microwave admissions safety test at the same time.</p><p>  
</p><p>The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 puts the duty of care upon both the employer and the employee to ensure the safety of all persons using the work premises, this also includes the self employed. There are guidelines regarding how often an item of electrical equipment should be tested but HSE Guidance Notes advise "regular testing" which is generally interpreted as annual testing.</p><p>  
</p><p>This of course does depends on a number of different factors such as the age and type of equipment and if you have moved or introduced new items like a laptop in between your last test.</p><p>  
</p><p>PAT Testing is required if you rent a property.</p><p>
